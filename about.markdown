## Luke Fritz

I am a software and web developer in Meadville, Pennsylvania.

[I am available for hire.](mailto:luke@lukeandkrista.com)

### Site Design

The style of this site is exceedingly bland.

I am using CSS pseudo-elements and basic styling to make the documents appear as valid [YAML](http://yaml.org/) with embedded [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
